 * TraceSink — domain-level observability interface.

 * Sync/runtime code emits domain events through this interface.

 *
 * Design rules:
 *   - record() and recordPath() are non-blocking. They never return promises.
 *   - flush() is the only async/durability boundary.
 *   - Callers never need to await trace completion.
 *   - Implementation may queue async work (HMAC, redaction) internally.
